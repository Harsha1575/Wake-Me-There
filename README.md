# 🚆 Wake Me There

**Wake Me There** is a Flutter-based mobile application that helps users avoid missing their stops while traveling on buses or trains. It calculates the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) at a destination and triggers an alarm (sound/vibration) **before** reaching the stop.


## 📌 Features

✅ **Real-time ETA Calculation** – Fetches estimated arrival time using location data.  
✅ **Custom Alerts** – Sets alarms or notifications to wake you up before reaching your destination.  
✅ **Multiple Alert Modes** – Supports **sound notifications, vibrations, or pop-up alerts**.  
✅ **Background Execution** – Works even when the app is minimized (using Android Alarm Manager).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Flutter** – Cross-platform UI framework  
- **Google Maps API** – For location tracking and ETA calculations  
- **Dart** – Programming language for Flutter  
- **Android Alarm Manager** – To trigger alarms even in the background
